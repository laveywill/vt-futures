                1 have more homes than jobs. This usually means that most people
                who work in the county are able to find housing there, and some
                people commute outside of the county for work. Counties with a ratio
                very close to 0 are known as `bedroom communities` because most
                of the residents of the county do not work there -- there are many more
                homes than jobs. On the other
                hand, counties with a ratio greater than 1 have more jobs than
                homes. Most workers have to commute into the county because 
                there is not enough housing for everyone who works in the county.
                This ratio can help us understand which counties are able to support
                 an influx of population, and where counties can focus on development
                to help support a population increase. For example, bedroom 
                communities may want to work on adding jobs, while counties with
                more jobs than housing would want to prioritize building housing.")
